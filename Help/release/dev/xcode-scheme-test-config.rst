xcode-scheme-test-config
------------------------

* The :variable:`CMAKE_XCODE_SCHEME_TEST_CONFIGURATION` variable and corresponding
  :prop_tgt:`XCODE_SCHEME_TEST_CONFIGURATION` target property were added to tell
  the :generator:`Xcode` generator what to put in the scheme's "Build Configuration"
  setting for the test action.
