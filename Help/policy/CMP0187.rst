CMP0187
-------

.. versionadded:: 4.1

Include source file without an extension after the same name with an extension.

In CMake 4.0 and below, if two source files have the same filename and only one
file has a file extension and the file with the extension is listed first, the
file without the extension is omitted from the target.

For example, the following library target only include ``hello.c`` in the
target, but omits the file ``hello``.

.. code-block:: cmake

   add_library(library hello.c hello)

If the file without the extension is listed before the file with the extension,
both files are included in the target.

Starting in CMake 4.1, CMake includes both files in the library target.

This policy has no effect if :policy:`CMP0115` uses the ``OLD`` behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to omit the file without the extension.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to include it.
