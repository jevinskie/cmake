.. versionadded:: 4.2

:variable:`CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE` is not defined in ``CMakeLists.txt``.

CMake 4.1 and below defined ``CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE`` when processing
a ``CMakeLists.txt`` even though there is no parent file.  CMake 4.2
and above prefer to not define ``CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE``.  This policy
provides compatibility for projects that accidentally relied on the
old behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to set
:variable:`CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE` to :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE`
when processing a ``CMakeLists.txt``.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy
is to not set :variable:`CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE`.
