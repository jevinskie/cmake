.. versionadded:: 3.12

Include file check macros honor ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``.

In CMake 3.12 and above, the

* ``check_include_file()`` command in the :module:`CheckIncludeFile` module, the
* ``check_include_file_cxx()`` command in the
  :module:`CheckIncludeFileCXX` module, and the
* ``check_include_files()`` command in the :module:`CheckIncludeFiles` module

now prefer to link the check executable to the libraries listed in the
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES`` variable.  This policy provides compatibility
with projects that have not been updated to expect this behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
in the include file check commands.  The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to
honor ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES`` in the include file check commands.
