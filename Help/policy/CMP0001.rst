``CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` should no longer be used.

The behavior is to check ``CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` and present
it to the user.  The ``NEW`` behavior is to ignore
``CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` completely.

In CMake 2.4 and below the variable ``CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` was
used to request compatibility with earlier versions of CMake.  In
CMake 2.6 and above all compatibility issues are handled by policies
and the :command:`cmake_policy` command.  However, CMake must still check
``CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` for projects written for CMake 2.4 and
below.
