.. versionadded:: 4.1

The :module:`CMakeDetermineVSServicePack` module is removed.

The ``CMakeDetermineVSServicePack`` module has long been superseded by
the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION` variable, and the module
has been documented as deprecated since CMake 3.0.  CMake 4.1 and above
prefer to not provide the module.  This policy provides compatibility
for projects that have not been ported away from it.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for
``include(CMakeDetermineVSServicePack)`` to load the deprecated module.
The ``NEW`` behavior halts with a fatal error if anything tries to include
the module.
