.. versionadded:: 3.32

Create shared library archives by default on AIX.

CMake 3.30 and below always represented ``SHARED`` library targets
as plain shared object ``.so`` files.  This is consistent with other
UNIX platforms, but is not the preferred convention on AIX.
CMake 3.31 added the :prop_tgt:`AIX_SHARED_LIBRARY_ARCHIVE` target
property to create a shared library archive: the shared object ``.so``
file is placed inside an archive ``.a`` file.  However, the behavior
was disabled by default for compatibility with existing projects that
do not set :prop_tgt:`AIX_SHARED_LIBRARY_ARCHIVE`.

CMake 3.32 and above prefer, when :prop_tgt:`AIX_SHARED_LIBRARY_ARCHIVE`
is not set, to enable creation of shared library archives by default
because it is the preferred convention on AIX.  This policy provides
compatibility for projects that have not been updated.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to disable shared library
archives when :prop_tgt:`AIX_SHARED_LIBRARY_ARCHIVE` is not set.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to enable shared library
archives when :prop_tgt:`AIX_SHARED_LIBRARY_ARCHIVE` is not set.
