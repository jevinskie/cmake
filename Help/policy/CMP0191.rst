.. versionadded:: 4.1

The :module:`FindCABLE` module is removed.

CMake 4.0 and below provide the :module:`FindCABLE` module, but the CABLE
tool is no longer maintained.  CMake 4.1 and above prefer to not provide
the :module:`FindCABLE` module.  This policy provides compatibility for
projects that have not been ported away from it.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for ``find_package(CABLE)`` to load
the deprecated module.  The ``NEW`` behavior is for ``find_package(CABLE)``
to fail as if the module does not exist.
