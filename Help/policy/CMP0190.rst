.. versionadded:: 4.1

Modules :module:`FindPython3`, :module:`FindPython2` and :module:`FindPython`
enforce consistency of artifacts in cross-compiling mode.

Starting with CMake 4.1, Modules :module:`FindPython3`, :module:`FindPython2`
and :module:`FindPython` apply, in cross-compiling mode (i.e. the
:variable:`CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING` variable is set to true), the following
constraints to the requested components:

* ``Interpreter`` or ``Compiler`` alone: the host artifacts will be searched.
* ``Interpreter`` or ``Compiler`` with ``Development`` or any sub-component:
  The target artifacts will be searched. In this case, the
  :variable:`CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR` variable must be defined and will
  be used to execute the interpreter or the compiler.

This policy provides compatibility with projects that expect the legacy
behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy does not enforce consistency in
cross-compiling mode and will, potentially, returns a mix of artifacts
(i.e. host and target artifacts).
