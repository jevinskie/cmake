CheckCXXSourceCompiles
----------------------

Check once if C++ source code can be built.

.. command:: check_cxx_source_compiles

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_cxx_source_compiles(<code> <resultVar>
                              [FAIL_REGEX <regex1> [<regex2>...]])

  Check once that the source supplied in ``<code>`` can be built. The result is
  stored in the internal cache variable specified by ``<resultVar>``, with
  boolean ``true`` for success and boolean ``false`` for failure.

  If ``FAIL_REGEX`` is provided, then failure is determined by checking
  if anything in the compiler output matches any of the specified regular
  expressions.

  Internally, :command:`try_compile` is used to compile the source. If
  :variable:`CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE` is set to ``EXECUTABLE`` (default),
  the source is compiled and linked as an executable program. If set to
  ``STATIC_LIBRARY``, the source is compiled but not linked. In any case, all
  functions must be declared as usual.

  See also :command:`check_source_compiles` for a more general command syntax.

  See also :command:`check_source_runs` to run compiled source.

  The compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the
  following variables prior to calling ``check_cxx_source_compiles()``:

.. include:: /module/include/CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS.rst
