FindSDL_sound
-------------

Finds the SDL_sound library, an abstract soundfile decoder for use in SDL
(Simple DirectMedia Layer) applications.

.. note::

  This module is specifically intended for SDL_sound version 1.  Starting with
  version 2.0.2, SDL_sound provides a CMake package configuration file when
  built with CMake and should be found using ``find_package(SDL2_sound)``.
  These newer versions provide :ref:`Imported Targets` that encapsulate usage
  requirements.  Refer to the upstream SDL_sound documentation for more
  information.

.. note::
  This module depends on SDL being found and must be called after the
  :module:`find_package(SDL) <FindSDL>`.

  Depending on how the SDL_sound library is built, it may require additional
  dependent libraries to be found for this module to succeed.  These
  dependencies may include MikMod, ModPlug, Ogg, Vorbis, SMPEG, FLAC, and Speex.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following variables:

``SDL_sound_FOUND``
  Boolean indicating whether the (requested version of) SDL_sound library is
  found.  For backward compatibility, the ``SDL_SOUND_FOUND`` variable is also
  set to the same value.

``SDL_SOUND_VERSION_STRING``
  The human-readable string containing the version of SDL_sound found.

``SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES``
  Libraries needed to link against to use the SDL_sound library.

Cache Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following cache variables may also be set:

``SDL_SOUND_INCLUDE_DIR``
  The directory containing the ``SDL_sound.h`` and other headers needed to use
  the SDL_sound library.

``SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY``
  The name of just the SDL_sound library you would link against.  Use
  ``SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES`` for the link instructions and not this one.

``MIKMOD_LIBRARY``
  The path to the dependent MikMod library.

``MODPLUG_LIBRARY``
  The path to the dependent ModPlug library (libmodplug).

``OGG_LIBRARY``
  The path to the dependent Ogg library.

``VORBIS_LIBRARY``
  The path to the dependent Vorbis library.

``SMPEG_LIBRARY``
  The path to the dependent SMPEG library.

``FLAC_LIBRARY``
  The path to the dependent FLAC library.

``SPEEX_LIBRARY``
  The path to the dependent Speex library.

Hints
^^^^^

This module accepts the following variables:

``SDLDIR``
  Environment variable that can be set to help locate an SDL library installed
  in a custom location.  It should point to the installation destination that
  was used when configuring, building, and installing SDL library:
  ``./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR``.

  On macOS, setting this variable will prefer the Framework version (if found)
  over others.  In this case, the cache value of ``SDL_LIBRARY`` would need to
  be manually changed to override this selection or set the
  :variable:`CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH` variable to modify the search paths.

``SDLSOUNDDIR``
  Environment variable that works the same as ``SDLDIR``.

``SDL_SOUND_EXTRAS``
  This is an optional cache variable that can be used to add additional flags
  that are prepended to the ``SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES`` result variable.  This is
  available mostly for cases this module failed to anticipate for and additional
  flags must be added.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

Finding SDL_sound library and creating an imported interface target for linking
it to a project target:

.. code-block:: cmake

  find_package(SDL)
  find_package(SDL_sound)

  if(SDL_sound_FOUND AND NOT TARGET SDL::SDL_sound)
    add_library(SDL::SDL_sound INTERFACE IMPORTED)
    set_target_properties(
      SDL::SDL_sound
      PROPERTIES
        INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "${SDL_SOUND_INCLUDE_DIR}"
        INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES "${SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES}"
    )

    # Append the SDL dependency as imported target to be transitively linked:
    set_property(
      TARGET SDL::SDL_sound
      APPEND
      PROPERTY INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES SDL::SDL
    )
  endif()

  target_link_libraries(project_target PRIVATE SDL::SDL_sound)

When working with SDL_sound version 2, the upstream package provides the
``SDL2_sound::SDL2_sound`` imported target directly.  It can be used in a
project without using this module:

.. code-block:: cmake

  find_package(SDL2_sound)
  target_link_libraries(project_target PRIVATE SDL2_sound::SDL2_sound)

#]=======================================================================]


#[[
This module is a bit more complicated than the
other FindSDL* family modules.  The reason is that SDL_sound can be
compiled in a large variety of different ways which are independent of
platform.  SDL_sound may dynamically link against other 3rd party
libraries to get additional codec support, such as Ogg Vorbis, SMPEG,
ModPlug, MikMod, FLAC, Speex, and potentially others.  Under some
circumstances which I don't fully understand, there seems to be a
requirement that dependent libraries of libraries you use must also be
explicitly linked against in order to successfully compile.  SDL_sound
does not currently have any system in place to know how it was
compiled.  So this CMake module does the hard work in trying to
discover which 3rd party libraries are required for building (if any).
This module uses a brute force approach to create a test program that
uses SDL_sound, and then tries to build it.  If the build fails, it
parses the error output for known symbol names to figure out which
libraries are needed.
