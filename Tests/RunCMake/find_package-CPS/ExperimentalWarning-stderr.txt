CMake Warning at ExperimentalWarning\.cmake:[0-9]+ \(find_package\):
  By not providing "FindDoesNotExist\.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "DoesNotExist", but CMake did not find one\.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "DoesNotExist" with
  any of the following names:

    DoesNotExist\.cps
    doesnotexist\.cps
    DoesNotExistConfig\.cmake
    doesnotexist-config\.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "DoesNotExist" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "DoesNotExist_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files\.  If
  "DoesNotExist" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed\.
