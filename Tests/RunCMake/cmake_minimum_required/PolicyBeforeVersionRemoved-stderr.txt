^CMake Error at PolicyBeforeVersionRemoved\.cmake:1 \(cmake_policy\):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3\.5 has been removed from CMake\.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value\.  Or, use the <min>\.\.\.<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier\.

  Or, add -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3\.5 to try configuring anyway\.
