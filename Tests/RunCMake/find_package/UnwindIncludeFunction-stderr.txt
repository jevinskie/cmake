CMake Warning at UnwindInclude/UnwindFunction.cmake:4 \(find_package\):
  By not providing "Findfoo.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "foo", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "foo" with any of
  the following names:

    fooConfig.cmake
    foo-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "foo" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "foo_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "foo" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
