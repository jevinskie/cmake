CMake Error at RequiredVarOptional.cmake:[0-9]+ \(find_package\):
  By not providing "FindDoesNotExist.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "DoesNotExist", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "DoesNotExist" with
  any of the following names:

    DoesNotExistConfig.cmake
    doesnotexist-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "DoesNotExist" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "DoesNotExist_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "DoesNotExist" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.

  This package is considered required because the CMAKE_FIND_REQUIRED
  variable has been enabled.
