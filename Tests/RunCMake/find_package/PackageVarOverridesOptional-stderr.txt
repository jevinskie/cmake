CMake Error at PackageVarOverridesOptional.cmake:[0-9]+ \(find_package\):
  By not providing "FindFoo.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Foo", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Foo" with any of
  the following names:

    FooConfig.cmake
    foo-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Foo" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "Foo_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Foo" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.

  This package is considered required because the
  CMAKE_REQUIRE_FIND_PACKAGE_Foo variable has been enabled.
