  FindViaModule.cmake must either be part of this project itself, in this
  case adjust CMAKE_MODULE_PATH so that it points to the correct location

  Or it must be installed by a package which has already been found via
  find_package\(\).  In this case make sure that package has indeed been found
  and adjust CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to contain the location where that package has
  installed FindViaModule.cmake.  This must be a location provided by that
  package.  This error in general means that the buildsystem of this project
  is relying on a Find-module without ensuring that it is actually available.
