CMake Error in CMakeLists.txt:
  install\(EXPORT "bar" ...\) includes target "bar" which requires target "foo"
  that is not in this export set, but in multiple other export sets:
  cmake/foo.cmake, cps/foo.cps, cmake/foo-alt.cmake.

  An exported target cannot depend upon another target which is exported in
  more than one export set or with more than one namespace.  Consider
  consolidating the exports of the "foo" target to a single export.
